Title: Developing an Interactive Telegram Bot for Scraping Metadata of Academic Papers

  **Abstract:

This paper presents the design and implementation of an interactive Telegram bot utilizing the pyTelegramBotAPI library to scrap and deliver metadata from academic papers. The bot enables users to request and receive information such as titles, authors, publication dates, abstracts, and DOIs directly through Telegram, streamlining access to scholarly data. The development process encompasses web scraping techniques, bot integration, and user interface design, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

1. Introduction

Accessing comprehensive metadata of academic papers is essential for researchers and professionals. Traditional methods often involve manual searches across multiple databases, which can be time-consuming. This study introduces a Telegram bot that automates the retrieval of academic paper metadata, providing users with a seamless and efficient tool for accessing scholarly information.

2. Literature Review

Web scraping has emerged as a powerful technique for extracting data from websites, facilitating the collection of large datasets for research purposes. Previous studies have explored various aspects of web scraping, including its applications in academic research and the development of tools for data extraction. However, integrating web scraping with messaging platforms like Telegram for real-time data delivery remains an area with limited exploration.

3. Methodology

    3.1 Web Scraping

    *The bot employs Python's BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and extract metadata from academic paper repositories. The scraping process involves:*

    I*dentifying Target Sources: Selecting reputable academic databases or websites for data extraction.*

    *Parsing HTML Content: Using BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract relevant metadata fields.*

    *Data Storage: Organizing the extracted data into a structured format, such as a database or CSV file, for easy retrieval.*

    3.2 Telegram Bot Integration

    *The pyTelegramBotAPI library facilitates the creation of the Telegram bot, which includes:*

    *Bot Setup: Registering the bot with Telegram and obtaining the API token.*

*Command Handlers: Implementing functions to process user inputs and trigger the appropriate scraping functions.*

*User Interaction: Designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to request metadata and receive responses in a readable format.*

4. Results

The developed Telegram bot successfully retrieves and delivers academic paper metadata upon user request. The bot's performance was evaluated based on:

Accuracy: Correctness of the extracted metadata.

Response Time: Speed of delivering information to users.

User Satisfaction: Feedback from users regarding the bot's usability and functionality.

5. Discussion

Integrating web scraping with a Telegram bot offers a convenient method for accessing academic paper metadata. The study highlights the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines in web scraping, including respecting terms of service and implementing rate limiting to prevent server overload. The user feedback indicates a positive reception, with users appreciating the ease of accessing scholarly information through the bot.

6. Conclusion

The research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using a Telegram bot to scrape and deliver academic paper metadata. This approach enhances accessibility to scholarly data, benefiting researchers and professionals by providing a streamlined method for obtaining relevant information. Future work may involve expanding the bot's capabilities to include additional features, such as full-text retrieval and integration with multiple databases.
